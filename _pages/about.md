I am currently a 5th year PhD student in the Department of Economics at Columbia University. 

My research interests include networks and game theory. I am advised by Prof. Evan Sadler.

I graduated _Summa Cum Laude_ in Economics and _Magna Cum Laude_ in Mathematics (Concentration in Pure Math) with Minors in Computer Science and Law & Society from Cornell University in May 2021. 

My CV is linked [here](..\files\Steve_Yeh_CV.pdf).

## Working Papers

[A Shocking Reversal: Flipping Complements and Substitutes in Network Games](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6109228) with E. Sadler

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  In conventional network games, each player chooses one action that impacts all of her neighbors. We study players that select neighbor-specific efforts and face a convex total effort cost. Our main result highlights a striking reversal in comparative statics: When bilateral efforts are strategic complements (substitutes), shocks propagate through the network in a pattern befitting strategic substitutes (complements) in standard network games. This reversal, together with other fundamental changes in player behavior, suggests that retaining the single effort assumption when it is not appropriate may lead to poor policy recommendations.

[Optimal Project Task Assignments](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4999892)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  A principal assigns agents to tasks in a multi-task project. Agents tend to shirk at their tasks and rely on others’ efforts because effort on one task substitutes for effort on similar tasks. Assigning the same agent to more tasks mitigates free-riding, but convex effort costs prevent him from completing all of his tasks. For a class of projects, an optimal task assignment assigns each agent to a module comprising a task central to the project and all locally related tasks. For general projects, modular task assignments are approximately optimal with a performance guarantee that depends on a project's task structure.

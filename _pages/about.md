I am currently a 5th year PhD student in the Department of Economics at Columbia University. 

My research interests include game theory and networks. I am advised by Prof. Evan Sadler.

I graduated _Summa Cum Laude_ in Economics and _Magna Cum Laude_ in Mathematics (Concentration in Pure Math) with Minors in Computer Science and Law & Society from Cornell University in May 2021. 

My CV is linked [here](..\files\Steve_Yeh_CV.pdf).

[Optimal Project Task Assignments](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4999892)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  A principal assigns agents to tasks in a multi-task project. Agents tend to shirk at their tasks and rely on others’ efforts because effort on one task substitutes for effort on similar tasks. Assigning the same agent to more tasks mitigates free-riding, but convex effort costs prevent him from completing all of his tasks. For a class of projects, an optimal task assignment assigns each agent to a module comprising a task central to the project and all locally related tasks. For general projects, modular task assignments are approximately optimal with a performance guarantee that depends on a project's task structure.

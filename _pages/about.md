I am currently a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Economics at Columbia University. 

My research interests include game theory and networks. I am advised by Prof. Evan Sadler.

I graduated _Summa Cum Laude_ in Economics and _Magna Cum Laude_ in Mathematics (Concentration in Pure Math) with Minors in Computer Science and Law & Society from Cornell University in May 2021. 

My CV is linked [here](..\files\Steve_Yeh_CV.pdf).

[Optimal Task Assignments for Projects](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4999892)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  A principal assigns tasks to agents working on a multi-task project. Effort on one task substitutes for effort on similar tasks. Assigning each agent to a few tasks lightens workloads, but agents tend to shirk and rely on othersâ€™ efforts. Assigning the same agent to more tasks mitigates free-riding but may prevent an agent from completing all their assigned tasks due to convex effort costs. I study optimal task assignments in key-peripheral projects: those that comprise peripheral tasks (linked to one other task) and key tasks (linked to multiple peripheral tasks). I show that the modular task assignment, where each agent handles a module consisting of a key task and all its associated peripheral tasks, is optimal when all key tasks are, in a certain sense, sufficiently ``specialized." For non-key-peripheral projects, further assumptions on effort costs and project structure are needed to characterize the optimal assignment.

I am currently a 1st year Economics Ph.D. student at Columbia University. I graduated _Summa Cum Laude_ in Economics and _Magna Cum Laude_ in Mathematics (Concentration in Mathematics) with Minors in Computer Science and Law & Society from Cornell University in May 2021.

My research focuses on microeconomic theory, labor economics and development economics.
